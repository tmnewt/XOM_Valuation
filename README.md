# XOM_Valuation
Valuation project for ExxonMobil

This file contains a macro which helps in the valuation model. The excel file is essentially useless and hilariously inaccurate without it.  

## Getting Started:
Before downloading the file you will need to set up a trusted file location on your computer.

1. Open a blank excel file.
2. Select **File**, then at the bottom (you may have to scroll) select **Options**. A window will open up.
3) On the left hand side of this window select **Trust Center**, then select **Trust Center Settings...** a new window will open.
4) On the left hand side of this new window select **Trusted Locations**
5) At the bottom select **Add new location...** Another smaller window will pop up.
6) Select **Browse...** and select the file location you'd like to use (like your desktop).
7) Select **Ok**.

Now download the file and move it to this trusted location. It should open.

When you are done and want to remove the trusted file location, repeat steps 1 to 4, then click on the path under user locations and then select **remove**.
